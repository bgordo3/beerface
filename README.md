# beerface
[Chernoff faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face) data visualization of beer brewing styles.

The beer style characteristics are from the [BJCP Style Guidelines](http://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php) from 2008, 
specifically the XML version available here: http://www.bjcp.org/docs/xmlstyleguide.zip.  The facial features of
the Chernoff faces are generated using the average of the low/high values for IBU, SRM, OG, FG, and ABV in each beer
category.
